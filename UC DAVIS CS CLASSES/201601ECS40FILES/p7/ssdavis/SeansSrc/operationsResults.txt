If life is merely a joke, the question still remains:  for whose amusement?

It is possible that my whole purpose in life is simply to serve as a warning to
others.

This life is mine!  Some of it was given to me; the rest, I made myself.

Why is not there some cheap and easy way I can prove how much you mean to me?

Everybody is entitled to my opinion.

I can admit to myself that I was wrong, but I will never admit it to you.

All I ask of Life is a constant and exaggerated sense of my own importance.

I need more time, and I probably always will.

Why dies trouble always come at the wrong time?

By doing just a little every day, I can gradually let the task completely
overwhelm me.

I recently had my problems on the run,  but now they have re-grouped, and are
making another attack.

To be sure of hitting the target, shoot first and, whatever you hit, call it
the target.

Thinking about it is easier than doing it--but so far, I have not even
thought about it.

If you cannot learn to do it well, learn to enjoy doing it badly.

Tomorrow, this will be part of the unchangeable past, but fortunately, it can
still be changed today.

What makes the Universe so hard to comprehend is that there is nothing to
compare it with.

All from "I may not be Totally Perfect, but Parts of Me are Excellent" by
A. Brilliant.
